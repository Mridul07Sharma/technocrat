It happens many times that we look for a plumber, a mechanic or labor, etc but we are unable to find them due to either less medium of connectivity or some other reason.
Due to this many people who are skilled in these works remain unemployed and as well as our work also got delayed. 
This problem might seem too small but it affects the economic growth of the nation on a large scale

We built ES-Crew with the motive to ensure the connectivity between these workers and the workplaces or people who are looking for them
We provide a separate login portal for both job seekers and job providers.
So, the people have to no longer search for a plumber, mechanic or a worker here and there, they can directly visit our website and can provide employment to people skilled in 
these works.

Our idea is one of its kind.. There is no such website in the market that provides services like us.You have seen many websites on the internet which use to provide job 
facilities to the educated and skilled people but our idea is different in such a way that we use to provide job opportunities to a person who can perform any type of work like 
an electrician, plumber, mechanic or labor which can be used in any type of business activities, etc and they don't need to show any education qualification for their work.
With this, we are also providing common people a collective platform to search for all the basic services for which they look for in their day-to-day life.
